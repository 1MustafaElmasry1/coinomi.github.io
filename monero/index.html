        <strong>Proposal: Monero Light Client libraries and Indexer development.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to develop open source implementations of monero transaction signing for other languages like Java and Rust. All current libraries like for example python, nodejs are in reality API consumers of monerod, thus an alternative implementation will help other projects. In addition to the signing of the transactions the development of a fast indexer is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the above is in place, Monero will be added to Coinomi Wallet by Coinomi for no charge other than the servers running cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Main goals:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transaction Java class, loosely compatible with Bitcoinj that can serialize, deserialize and sign provided a list of outputs/mixin-pubkeys. An extensive unit test suite is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indexer server that will consume the monerod API to index transaction histories, hold watch-keys (preferably in a HSM), notify the user, organize co-signing etc. The indexer shall be written in Rust, due to its speed, memory safety and powerful type system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transaction structs, traits for Rust that can serialize, deserialize and sign provided a list of outputs/mixin-pubkeys. An extensive unit test suite is required.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Stretch goals:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cryptonote ring signatures, EdDSA and transaction support for the CrypTech open source HSM board. An extensive unit test suite is required. With the above the indexer can use a CrypTech HSM to enhance privacy, co-sign transactions etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Developers needed:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monero protocol knowledge, ring signatures, transaction serialization format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Java or Rust knowledge
          </li>
          <li>
            Async IO (for indexer)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

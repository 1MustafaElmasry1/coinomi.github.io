    <strong>Proposal: Monero Light Client libraries and Indexer development.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to develop open source implementations of monero transaction signing for Java. In addition to the signing of the transactions the development of a fast indexer is needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the above is in place, Monero will be added to Coinomi Wallet by Coinomi for no charge other than the servers running cost which will be covered by sponsorships and does not affect the end users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Main goals:
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transaction Java class(s), loosely compatible with Bitcoinj that can serialize, deserialize and sign provided a list of outputs/mixin-pubkeys. An extensive unit test suite is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Indexer server that will consume the monerod API to index transaction histories, hold watch-keys (preferably in an HSM), notify connected users of any updates. The indexer API can be similar to the Electrum API. The indexer should be written in C++ to take advantage of the existing code.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Developers needed:
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Monero protocol knowledge, ring signatures, transaction serialization format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java or C++ knowledge
      </li>
      <li>
        Async IO (for indexer)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
